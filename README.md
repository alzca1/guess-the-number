# guess-the-number

Game developed in python to play the "Guess the number" game. Two difficulty levels ('easy' and 'hard') implemented that
give you the opportunity to guess a random number between 1 and 100. If you choose the 'easy' level, it'll give you 10 
attempts, whilst the 'hard' level will push the bar a little bit and it'll only give you 5 attempts to guess the number. 

Have fun!
